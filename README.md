# hello-world
My first Github Repository

The tutorial told me to tell something about myself. Well, I'm male, mid 30's, married and without a job.
I have some computer affinity, but not that much. 
So I was learning this stuff at Codecademy.com
https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/deploy-a-website/lessons/github-pages/exercises/create-repo
But I already know many ways to deploy a website or webserver.
Nevermind.
